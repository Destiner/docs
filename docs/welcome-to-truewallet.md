# Welcome to TrueWallet
At TrueWallet, we are unwavering in our commitment to enhancing your CryptoWallet experience and providing cutting-edge solutions to meet your evolving needs. We are excited to introduce our proposal for an improved online service that focuses on the innovative concept of Account Abstraction (ERC-4337).

 Key Enhancements We Aim to Implement:

1. Account Abstraction Integration: Our vision for an advanced online service involves the seamless integration of Account Abstraction. This technology allows users to interact with smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) directly from their crypto wallet, simplifying the user experience and broadening the utility of your digital assets.
2. Streamlined Smart Contract Interaction: With Account Abstraction, we aim to eliminate the need for external accounts and complex gas management, enabling users to interact with smart contracts as effortlessly as sending a regular transaction.
3. Enhanced DeFi and DApp Access: Account Abstraction opens the doors to an array of DeFi platforms and DApps. You'll be able to lend, borrow, swap, stake, and participate in other DeFi activities with unprecedented ease, directly from your crypto wallet.
4. Security by Design: Account Abstraction will be implemented with robust security measures to ensure the safety of your digital assets and transactions. We're dedicated to providing a secure environment for your crypto interactions.
5. Integration with NFTs: Account Abstraction will extend its utility to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), enabling users to mint, trade, and engage with NFTs directly through the crypto wallet.
6. Community Collaboration: We envision building a thriving user community centered around Account Abstraction, where users can share knowledge, insights, and tips, contributing to a collective understanding of this cutting-edge technology.
7. Custom Features and Individual Integrations: We provide tailored solutions that perfectly align with your unique business needs. By crafting these specific features and connections, you can optimize your systems to work together seamlessly and efficiently, enhancing productivity and addressing your organization's distinct requirements.

* [Smart Account](https://github.com/TrueWallet/contracts)
* [Javascript SDK](https://github.com/TrueWallet/js-sdk)

## Decentralization
We prefer the blockchain way, which brings us decentralization, transparency, openness, and anonymity. So, we are trying to follow it where it can be possible. 

The project provides a centralized API service, but its main goal is to simplify some staff and it is optional to use.

TrueWallet is a non-custodial wallet. It doesn't store any private keys and provides solutions to eliminate private key storing for other projects or their users where it can.
