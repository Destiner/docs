_This contract provides functionality to execute AA (ERC-4337) UserOperetion
It allows to receive and manage assets using the owner account of the smart contract wallet_

## Functions

### onlyOwner

_Only from EOA owner, or through the account itself (which gets redirected through execute())_

```solidity
modifier onlyOwner();
```

### onlyEntryPointOrOwner

Validate that only the entryPoint or Owner is able to call a method

```solidity
modifier onlyEntryPointOrOwner();
```

### constructor

_This prevents initialization of the implementation contract itself_

```solidity
constructor();
```

### initialize

Initialize function to setup the true wallet contract

```solidity
function initialize(address _entryPoint, address _owner, uint32 _upgradeDelay) public initializer;
```

**Parameters**
